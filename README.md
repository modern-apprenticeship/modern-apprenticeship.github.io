Modern Apprenticeship Blog

#Post Structure
Each post should have a Title, a tag or tags, an Author, a Tagline for the homepage listing, size, and a category.

##Title
Okay that one's easy

##Tags
Tags will enable posts to be listed in several categories, featured at the bottom of the homepage where they are grouped by tags.

##Author
Again, just a simple 'Paul Pagel', or 'Richard Nixon'

##Taginline
This is the hook. Instead of displaying the first few lines of each post on the homepage, this will be displayed. That way you are not limited by the introductory sentence of the post, or if you want to start with an image or graph, or Uncle Bob style non-sequiter to begin. Should only be a sentence or two tops.

##Category
Category will determine if a blog post is 'featured' or not. Featured posts will be displayed under the mission statement, but above the list of normal posts.


##Size
Size will determine either half width or full width in the normal post listings in the center of the index. Setting to 'large' will make the post preview take up both columns, while not setting a size will default to the normal half width preview.
