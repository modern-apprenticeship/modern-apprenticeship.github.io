  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Apprenticeships are immersive experiences that should consume all of an apprentice’s attention. They require a steady and unwavering dedication to practice. But it’s unrealistic to think that even the most driven apprentices don’t have multiple interests outside of their chosen craft. Everybody has hobbies that we do for reasons other than a humble pursuit of mastery. They entertain us, they distract us, and they can even refuel us.</p>

<p>In his popular book Mastery, George Leonard outlined four types of learners that I’ve listed below. He presents three of these learners as character profiles of people who enter a craft with the wrong mental approach, and uses these descriptions to help diagnose and explain reasons why a particular learner will fail on their path to mastery. </p>

<p>But I don’t think it’s helpful to take such a pessimistic view of these descriptions, because I don’t think we should take such a singular view of learning. We are all different types of learners for different crafts, and it’s healthy to take these different roles in different areas of our lives. It helps broaden our perspective, and can be a useful leisure activity that allows us to approach our chosen craft each day with renewed vigor. </p>

<h3 id="the-dabbler">The Dabbler</h3>
<p>Any naturally curious person has dabbled in several different interests. In my lifetime, I’ve spent time learning to make coffee and building small woodworking projects just to satiate some inner curiosity about these crafts. I’m not an expert in either of them, but I’m content with my surface-level comprehension. I’m a novice in many different crafts, and I think this broad familiarity is beneficial. We all need hobbies that are relaxing and fun without requiring an intense attention.</p>

<h3 id="the-hacker">The Hacker</h3>
<p>If someone has their sights set on accomplishing a large goal, she or he is likely to become a hacker in a handful of crafts that stand in the way of that goal. Many people who attend code schools or who take online software classes are learning to code not for their vocation, but because they understand the role software can play in achieving their goals. There are always hurdles between where you are and where you want to be, and oftentimes it’s sufficient to be a hacker in them and learn only as much as you need to in order to get past them.</p>

<p>I began hacking as an entrepreneur so that I could achieve my goal of providing a software consultancy that was built on the pillars of software craftsmanship. But while I learned more about business and built my company, I began appreciating the nuance and the process of business management. That’s when I began creating something like an apprenticeship for myself. I joined the Entrepreneurs’ Organization to surround myself with mentors, and entered the Executive Masters of Business program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management to continue on my path toward mastery.</p>

<h3 id="the-obsessive">The Obsessive</h3>
<p>Typically, we’re obsessive about things that appeal to our competitive drives. The quest is to come out ahead in something, and the drive is internal and self-motivated. When I register to run a marathon, I’m extremely motivated to train for that marathon. I run obsessively. I buy sports equipment that will help me conquer the goal. But when the marathon is over, I no longer feel motivated to run. I loved running while I had something competitive to look forward to; but once that competitive drive was gone, so was my interest in seeking improvement.</p>

<h3 id="the-apprentice">The Apprentice</h3>
<p>It is possible for you to be different character types for different crafts, and it is also possible for you to transition from one character type to another within the same craft. If you dabble in a field for long enough, you might encounter a study that inspires you to pursue that craft. Some of 8th Light’s craftsmen began learning to code while pursuing an older craft, only to discover their passion for writing code. It is also possible to begin learning a craft as competition, only to be awestruck and prompted to dive into an apprenticeship to learn it for its own sake.</p>

<p>The path to mastery is a challenging and demanding task that never ends. It’s a massive commitment, and we don’t need to make it every time we pick up a hobby. </p>
