    <br />

    <p>Paul Pagel was one of the first formally trained apprentices in the software craftsmanship movement. He spent several years under the mentorship of Uncle Bob Martin and Micah Martin before leading multiple projects as a consultant for the esteemed Object Mentor.</p>

<p>In 2006, Paul co-founded 8th Light with Micah Martin, and doubled down on the model of modern apprenticeship. Under his direction, 8th Light has hired more than 70 developers and designers, all of whom graduated from his apprenticeship program. This program has grown and improved over the last eight years, and provides self-motivated workers with the tools, opportunities, and guidance to become masters in their craft.</p>

    <p>Paul has given presentations on software craftsmanship and apprenticeship at numerous conferences, including <a href="http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Modern%20Apprenticeships">GoTo Berlin 2014</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/41956660">Ignite Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/677-rubyconf2011-a-mentor-in-the-limelight">Ruby Conference</a>, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/9740822">Software Craftsmanship North America</a>.

    <p class='bio'>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. <a href="#">Contact Paul</a></p>

    <p class='bio'>I leave you gentleman now. You will now write it; you will interpret it; that's your right. But as I leave you I want you to know.... just think how much you're going to be missing. You don't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference, and I hope that what I have said today will at least make television, radio, the press recognize that they have a right and a responsibility, if they're against a candidate give him the shaft, but also recognize if they give him the shaft, put one lonely reporter on the campaign who'll report what the candidate says now and then. Thank you, gentlemen, and good day. <a href="#">Contact Richard</a></p>
